# Homemade Pasta

## Yield

1 lb pasta

## Ingredients

-   Flour, 2 cups
-   Sea salt, 0.5 tsp
-   Large eggs, 3 count

## Preparation

-   Combine flour & salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add eggs. Gently mix eggs and fold in flour until a stiff dough forms.
-   Knead dough (8-10 min). If dough is too dry, sprinkle in water. The dough should grow more pliable and become smooth the longer you work it.
-   Cover with plastic wrap and let rest (45 min).
-   With a rolling pin on a well-floured surface, roll dough as thin as possible. Cut into thin strips, coating with a coarse flour (semolina?) to prevent noodles from sticking together.
-   Hang noodles on a hanger for at least 30 minutes to allow them to dry (reduces chewy-ness).

## Cooking

-   In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
-   Cook pasta until al dente (3-4 min).
