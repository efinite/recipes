## Yield

14 slices

## Ingredients

### Crust

-   Oreo cookies, 20 count
-   Butter, melted, 5 Tbsp

### Filling

-   Cream cheese, softened, 24 oz (675g)
-   Granulated sugar, 1 cup (200g)
-   Plain full fat yogurt or sour cream, 1 cup (240g)
-   Vanilla extract, 1.5 Tbsp
-   Almond extract, 1-2 tsp
-   Large eggs, 3 count
-   Oreo cookies, crumbled, 18 count

## Preparation & Baking

-   For the crust: Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat oven to 325Â°F.
    -   In a food processor or blender, pulse 20 Oreos to fine crumbs.
    -   In a medium mixing bowl stir together the Oreo crumbs and melted butter until well combined.
    -   Press mixture into an even layer in bottom of a 9.5 inch glass pie pan.
    -   Bake in preheated oven 9 - 10 minutes then allow to cool as you prepare the filling.
-   For the filling: In a mixing bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth and creamy.
    -   Add in the sour cream or yogurt and the vanilla and mix well.
    -   Add eggs one at a time and mix on low speed just until combined.
    -   Gently fold in 13-15 crumbled Oreo cookies. Do not over-mix. Pour the filling into the cooled crust.
-   Place the pie pan into a large glass casserole dish pan and place in the oven.
-   Fill the casserole dish up with hot water until the water level comes about halfway up the outside of the cheesecake pan.
-   Bake in preheated oven 50 - 60 minutes (more like 60-62), or until the center is almost set.
-   Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Let the cheesecake rest in the oven for 1 hour.
    -   Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
