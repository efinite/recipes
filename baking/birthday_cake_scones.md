# Birthday Cake Scones

## Yield

8 large scones

## Ingredients

-   Flour, 3 cups (375g)
-   Granulated sugar, 0.25 cup (50g) + 1 tsp (4g)
-   Baking powder, 2.5 tsp (12.5g)
-   Salt, 1 tsp (3g)
-   Cold unsalted butter, cubed (smaller the better), 1 cup (227g)

-   Almond extract, 1 tsp (4g)
-   Colored sprinkles

## Preparation

-   In large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using 2 forks, fold in chunks of butter until mixture crumbly. Next, add 1 cup milk and extracts, stirring until a shaggy dough forms. Finally, stir in sprinkles.
-   Turn dough onto a heavily floured surface and knead (1 min). Pat into a 1-inch thick circle. Cut into wedges. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
-   Brush with remaining milk and sprinkle with remaining sugar.

## Baking
