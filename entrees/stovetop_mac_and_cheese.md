# Stovetop Mac & Cheese

This recipe creates a thick and creamy mac & cheese. It is unique in that the pasta cooks in the sauce, thickening the sauce.

## Yield

? A lot

## Ingredients

-   Butter, 3.5 Tbsp (50g)
-   Flour, 3 Tbsp
-   2% Milk, 2 cups
-   Water, 2.5 cups
-   Elbow macaroni, uncooked, 2.5 cups (250g)
-   Mozzarella, shredded, 0.75 cups
-   Cheddar, colby, gruyere cheese mix, shredded, 1.5 cups
-   Salt & pepper (to taste)

## Cooking

-   In medium pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook (1 min).
-   Initially mix in 3/4 cup milk, then add the rest to form slurry. Add water.
-   Add macaroni and stir over high heat. Once you begin to see wisps of steam, drop heat to medium-low.
-   Stir regularly until sauce thickens some (9-10 min). Sauce will still be thinner than ideal when it is time to remove from heat!
