-   Salt, 3/4 tsp
-   Shaoxing wine or Dry Sherry, 3 Tbsp
-   Flour, 3/4 cup
-   Sesame seeds, toasted, 6 Tbsp
-   White pepper, ground, 3/8 tsp

### Vegetables

-   Broccoli, sliced, 2 large heads
-   Red bell peppers, diced, 3 count

### Sauce

-   Canola oil, 6 tsp
-   Garlic, 3 clove
-   Shaoxing wine or Dry Sherry, 3 Tbsp
-   Chicken stock, 2 1/4 cup
-   Rice wine vinegar, 1 1/2 tsp
-   Sugar, 8 Tbsp
-   Soy sauce, 4 Tbsp
-   Dark soy sauce, 1 Tbsp
-   Sesame oil, 6 tsp
-   Cornstarch, 2 Tbsp
-   Scallions, sliced, 1 bunch

## Preparation/Cooking

-   Mix the chicken with the cornstarch, sesame paste, salt, and wine and set aside for 10 minutes. Then mix the flour, sesame seeds, and white pepper in a separate bowl. Preheat the oven to 425F.
-   Use your hands to mix the chicken and marinade until there is no standing liquid. Dredge the chicken pieces in the dry mixture, and place them on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or nonstick foil. Bake at 425F for 8 minutes on the top rack. Flip the chicken pieces and broil on low for 3 minutes until golden brown. Remove from oven.
-   Working in batches, placed the vegetables into the steamer. For meal prepping purposes, steam until softened, but remove while still slightly under-cooked.
-   Heat your wok to medium heat and add oil and garlic. Stir for 5 seconds, and then add the wine. After another 5 seconds, add the chicken stock, rice wine vinegar, sugar, soy sauces, and sesame oil until everything's at a simmer.
-   Gradually add the cornstarch slurry to the sauce while stirring constantly. Let simmer for 20 seconds. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon. Add the chicken and some of the scallions and toss until coated with sauce.

## Serving

-   Serve over white rice\
-   Garnish with toasted sesame seed & green onion
