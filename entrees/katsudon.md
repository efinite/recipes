## Yield

\~2-3 servings

## Ingredients

Recipe can be scaled as required.

### Meat

-   Chicken breast (or pork), 1 count
-   Panko, 0.5 cups
-   Egg, beaten, 1 count + 2-3 for serving
-   Flour, 0.5 cups
-   salt (to taste)
-   Pepper (to taste)
-   Oil (for frying)

### Dashi broth

-   1 1/4 cups dashi stock (1.3 tsp dry Bonito soup stock/ 2.5 cups water)
-   2 Tbsp mirin
-   1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
-   1 Tbsp sugar

## Preparation

### Meat

-   On a cutting board, trim meat and filet each breast into 2-3 thinner filets. Batch tenderize the filets in a ziplock bag using the end of a sauce jar or similar object. If the filets begin to fray at the edges, too much force is being applied.
-   In 3 wide-mouth bowels, place the eggs, flour and panko. Fold salt and pepper into the flour as desired. Coat each filet serially in the egg mixture, flour, the egg mixture again, and panko.
-   Over medium/high heat, heat the oil in a flat pan and fry the filets until the panko turns a light-medium brown. The goal is to cook the meat mostly through, but not all the way as you will cook the meat one final time prior to serving.

### Dashi broth

Combine the dashi stock, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar in a large pot. Over high heat, stir and bring to a boil before removing from heat.

## Cooking

In a sauce pan, pour in enough broth to cover the base of the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat and add a filet. Beat one egg in a bowl and pour over the chicken. Remove from heat once the egg has fully cooked.

## Serving

Serve over steamed rice with garnish of sliced green onion.

## Notes(s)

To round out meal, consider a side of stir fried veggies (e.g. thinly wedged yellow onion, quartered carrots, thinly wedged bell peppers, broccoli head cut to bite size).
