## Preparation/Cooking

### Beef Stock

-   Preheat oven to 375F.
-   Place beef bones/meat and chopped onion, celery, and carrots on a rimmed sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes. After removing pan from oven, place contents directly into crockpot.
-   Enclose fresh thyme, parsley, bay leaves and corriander seeds in a tied cheese cloth and place in thr stock pot.
-   Fill stock pot with water until contents are just below water level. Cook on low for 6-8hrs. Skim off any fats/solids that float to surface while cooking.
-   Discard solids from stock, then filter through a seperate sheet of cheese cloth. Then reduce in a stock pot on the stove until there are approximately 2 qts of stock remaining. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Soup

-   Dice the baggette, toss bread with oil, then broil on a sheet pan until bread chunks lightly brown and crisp up. Remove from heat and set aside (do not cover or they will become soggy).
-   In a large sauce pan or dutch oven, carmelize onions with the butter and sugar until they turn a rich brown. It may be necessary to work in batches. Once onions are carmelized, stir in flour. Next add the Prosecco and scrape the carmelized bits off the bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Combine all with the beef stock, then add the balsamic. Finally, bring to a boil, then simmer partially covered for 30 minutes.
-   Taste and add salt/pepper to taste.

## Serving

-   Spoon soup mixture into small ramikens. Top with cubed bread and cover with shredded gruyere. Broil on a sheet pan until cheese melts and begins to brown.
-   Serve immediately.

## Note(s)

-   Can make stock ahead of time and freeze or use from store.
-   Ensure bread completely covered by cheese or it will burn.
-   Most photos of french onion soup show slices of baggette topping the soup, but cubed pieces are easier to eat.
-   Can consider pairing with a light salad.
