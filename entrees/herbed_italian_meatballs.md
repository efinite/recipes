## Preparation

Mix ingredients well in a bowl. Use wet hands to form mixture into small, 3.5-5 cm diameter balls.

## Cooking

### Option 1 - Stove-top

On medium-high heat, sear the meatballs in a sauce pan with oil until edges brown; goal is somewhat cooked through (3-8 min?). Turn heat to low (simmer). Add a red sauce to the pan and any additionally desired seasonings. Simmer meatballs in sauce for 20-30 min to finish cooking through and incorporate flavors.

### Option 2 - Oven

Preheat oven to 390F. Use shallow pan that will not drip grease. Spray with non-stick or cover with wax paper. Bake until meatballs turn grey (15-20 min?). Switch oven to broil and crisp the tops of the meatballs (1-4 min).

## Serving

-   Stand-alone hors d'oeuvres.
-   With a red sauce over pasta (spaghetti).
-   With a red sauce and soft cheese on garlic french bread (meatball sub style).

## Note(s)

-   Fresh herbs really bring out the flavor.
-   Can refrigerate meatball mixture for 30min before shaping to help meatballs maintain their shape.
-   Cut a finished meatball in half to verify cooked.
